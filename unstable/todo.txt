- Default camera view to focus on the center of mass of the level, instead of
on a selected star?

+ Menus/UI
	- Replace "Play" with "New Game"/"Continue"
	- Cleanup the success dialog. The order of the buttons (Next Level | Replay)
	seems backwards now. Perhaps move "Replay" somewhere else?
	- Are the scroll and zoom icons in the top right needed?
	- The tutorial dialogs are not obvious and should be cleaned up, or at least
	styled differently to make them harder to miss?

+ I need to re-record music
	- and add some smash boom bang sound effects
	- maybe some new title screen/credits music

+ related: possible juicing up / animating of failures
	- add some kind of screen transition for retry/reset?
	- slow time just before a collision?
	- grow-in the big bat-smash graphics?

+ Levels
	- More levels
	- Ability to encode levels in a shareable URL
	- Other level types? Perhaps things like planets that must get a specific
	number of orbits and no more?

- weird feature idea: different-colored orbit counters to require going around multiple bodies?
