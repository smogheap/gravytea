- Default camera view to focus on the center of mass of the level, instead of
on a selected star?

+ Menus/UI
	- Are the scroll and zoom icons in the top right needed?

+ Re-record music
	- and add some smash boom bang sound effects
	- maybe some new title screen/credits music

+ related: possible juicing up / animating of failures
	- add some kind of screen transition for retry/reset?
	- slow time just before a collision?
	- grow-in the big bat-smash graphics?

+ Levels
	- More levels
	- Ability to encode levels in a shareable URL
	- Option to require that a planet be ejected from the level, if we can find
	a reasonable way to detect this.
	- Option to require that a planet MUST crash
	- Option to require a min and max number of orbits for a planet before the
	level ends. May be used with multiple planets to force syncing, or with
	planets that must be ejected or crashed.

- weird feature idea: different-colored orbit counters to require going around multiple bodies?
